NAME
    Time::Business - Business Time Between Two Times

SYNOPSIS
      use Time::Business;
  
      my $btime = Time::Business->new({
                    WORKDAYS=>[1,2,3,4,5],
                    STARTIME=>900,
                    ENDTIME=>1700,
            })

      $start=time();
      $end=time()+86400;
      $seconds = $btime->calctime($start,$end);

DESCRIPTION
    Calculates the number of business seconds between two dates (specified
    in epoch seconds) given a list of working days and start and end times.

METHODS
  new({....})
    Setup a Time::Business object, passing the working time parameters. eg.

     my $btime = Time::Business->new({
                    WORKDAYS=>[1,2,3,4,5],
                    STARTIME=>'9:00',
                    STOPTIME=>'17:00',
            })

    where WORKDAYS is specified as a list of 0..6 where Sun is 0 and Sat is
    6.

  duration($start,$end) - Return number of business seconds.
    Returns the number of business seconds between $start and $end (seconds
    since epoch) given the parameters specified in the Time::Business->new.

  workTimeString($seconds) - Convert seconds to human readable work time.
    Converts the $seconds given to a string of the form "n days n hours n
    minutes". NOTE: This conversion is based on business hours so one day is
    one working day, not one 24 hour day. Useful for reports etc.
